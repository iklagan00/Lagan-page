My simple webpage..

Hi! Hello! I'm Ian Karl, currently a 3rd year student taking BS in Computer Science. I like playing mobile games that I have as of now like Arena of Valor and Clash of Clans. Sometimes in my free time, I read fiction books, and watching anime, tv shows, and movies. I love eating home-made foods like Caldereta, Sinigang, and Adobong Manok.
